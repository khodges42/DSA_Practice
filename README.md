# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Practice repository! This repository contains various implementations of data structures, algorithms, and machine learning techniques for educational purposes and practice.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each dedicated to a specific area of study. Currently, the repository contains the following folder:

### ML

The `ML` folder includes implementations of several machine learning algorithms using only basic libraries like NumPy and Python standard libraries. This folder serves as a practice ground for understanding and applying machine learning concepts. The following algorithms are implemented:

- **Decision Tree**: A simple decision tree classifier using recursive binary splits.
- **K-Means**: An unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data into `k` distinct groups.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A classification algorithm that assigns a class based on the majority vote from the `k` nearest neighbors.
- **Linear Regression**: A regression model for predicting a continuous outcome based on a linear relationship with features.
- **Logistic Regression**: A classification model for predicting probabilities of binary outcomes using a logistic function.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of feature independence.
- **Random Forests**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and robustness.
